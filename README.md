# Automating IAM Tasks in Linux with Bash Scripts

## Overview
This project provides a Bash script (`iam_setup.sh`) to automate Identity and Access Management (IAM) tasks on Linux systems. It creates users/groups, enforces password policies, sets file permissions, and logs all actions. Created as part of a system administration lab challenge.

# Files
users.txt - Input file containing user details in CSV format:
username,fullname,group

iam_setup.sh - Bash script that reads users.txt and performs IAM tasks.

iam_setup.log - Log file generated by the script, recording all actions with timestamps.

## Features
- **Group Management**: Auto-creates groups if they don't exist.
- **User Creation**: 
  - Creates users with home directories
  - Sets full names and group assignments
  - Enforces temporary passwords (`ChangeMe123`) with forced reset on first login
- **Security**: 
  - Home directories restricted to user-only access (`chmod 700`)
  - Optional password complexity checks
- **Logging**: Detailed timestamped logs in `iam_setup.log`
- **Extras** (Optional):
  - Email notifications for new users
  - CSV file input support

## Prerequisites
- Linux environment (physical/Virtual Machine/WSL)
- `sudo` privileges
- Basic Bash scripting knowledge
- Required commands: `useradd`, `usermod`, `passwd`, `chage`

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup Input File
Create `users.txt` with this format:
```csv
username,fullname,group
jdoe,John Doe,engineering
asmith,Alice Smith,engineering

# 2. Make the script executable:
chmod +x iam_setup.sh

# 3. Run the script with sudo:
sudo ./iam_setup.sh users.txt

# 4. What the Script Does
Checks if groups exist; creates them if missing.

Creates users with specified username, full name, and group.

Creates home directories for users.

Sets a temporary password (ChangeMe123).

Forces users to change their password on first login.

Sets home directory permissions to 700 (accessible only by the user).

Logs every action with a timestamp in iam_setup.log.
